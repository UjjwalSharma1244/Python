'''Explaination :

Here two sting are present if you want so you can also take as input from user using input method. anagram is a function where both string are passed as argument.
first of all we initilize the value of character as 256 because In the following implementation, it is assumed that the characters are stored using 8 bit and 
there can be 256 possible characters. then we create a 256 size of array for both strings. 
In First for loop(Line : 8) we check the all single string unicode value using ord() function. and store the value at that index using count[ord(i)] += 1 because the all index 
in count are 0 so the updates value is one in that index. if same string is present 2 or more time then there value is updated.
we follow this step in both string and create a new array called count1 and count2.

here is one thing is also important if len of both string are not same so it's not anagram

So now we check the both arrayy count1 and count2(Line : 18) if both values are same then the stirngs are also same so we can say that string is anagram.
if not so it's not anagram'''
